<!-- 
Step-by-Step Explanation of the Update Appointment Page
This HTML file provides an interface for doctors to update patient appointments, including time and date selection, with pre-filled patient and doctor information.

1. Declare the Document Type

   * Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` to ensure HTML5 standards for consistent rendering.

2. Begin the HTML Document with Language Attribute

   * Set `<html lang="en">` to specify English content.

3. Head Section – Metadata and Linked Resources

   * Begin the `<head>` section to include all meta, styles, and script references.

4. Set Character Encoding

   * Use `<meta charset="UTF-8">` to support universal character encoding.

5. Set the Favicon

   * Use a favicon for tab display:
     ```html
     <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="../assets/images/logo/logo.png" />
     ```

6. Set the Page Title

   * Title the document appropriately with:
     ```html
     <title>DoctorDashboard</title>
     ```

7. Link CSS Stylesheets

   * Include multiple stylesheets for UI consistency:
     - `adminDashboard.css` – for general dashboard layout.
     - `doctorDashboard.css` – for doctor-specific elements.
     - `updateAppointment.css` – for styles specific to the update form.
     - `style.css` – shared global styles.

8. Include JavaScript Files (Deferred)

   * Load JavaScript files using `defer` to prevent blocking:
     - `render.js` – for dynamic content rendering.
     - `util.js` – common utility functions.
     - `header.js` and `footer.js` – inject consistent header/footer sections.
     - `updateAppointment.js` – handles form submission logic and time population.

9. Body Initialization

   * Use `<body onload="renderContent()">` to trigger dynamic rendering on load.

10. Create the Container Layout

   * Structure the layout with `container` and `wrapper` divs for controlled spacing and responsiveness.

11. Add Dynamic Header

   * Use `<div id="header"></div>` to insert a shared header via JavaScript.

12. Define the Main Content Area

   * Inside `<div class="main-content">`, include a styled form for appointment updating.

13. Add the Form Elements

   * The form includes:
     - Disabled inputs for patient and doctor names (pre-filled).
     - Editable fields for date and time.
     - A dropdown (`select`) for appointment time options (to be filled dynamically).
     - Submit and Cancel buttons for update actions.

14. Add Footer Section

   * Use `<div id="footer"></div>` for dynamic footer injection.

15. Close All Tags Properly

   * Ensure all elements are properly closed to maintain clean and valid HTML structure.
